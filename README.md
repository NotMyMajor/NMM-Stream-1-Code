# NMM-Stream-1-Code
The program that we wrote in the first ever NotMyMajor live Twitch stream! Twitch chat gave me ideas for coding projects and I did my best to implement them! Enjoy and feel free to play around with my code and share what you make!

I've inlcuded a pre-packaged installer and the raw Python code as well! Feel free to use either!

## In this stream we:
Wrote a terrible little script that lets you print infinite cats, play some terrible tic-tac-toe, and randomly shuffle a deck of cards forever!
